hacktoolkit
===========

Hacktoolkit is the ONE open source project to rule them all (we try to, at least).

## Hacktoolkit vs hacktoolkit

Use Hacktoolkit (capital, proper name) when referring to the project or code.

Use `hacktoolkit` (all lowercase) only when referring to the code, library, or package name.

Java package names, for example, should start with `com.hacktoolkit`

## This README

This README is about the hacktoolkit library hosted at: https://github.com/hacktoolkit/hacktoolkit

For information about the project, see the website: http://hacktoolkit.com

* There will only be one repository, ever, for hacktoolkit.
* The goal is to be one repository that users can clone and immediately start using, not 47 different repositories.
* Code is organized into sub-folders, each with their own READMEs.
* Always read the README files in subdirectories before using the code so that your computer or mobile device doesn't blow up.

## Contributing

* Always include a README file in each directory, unless it is a leaf
* Follow the best practices and coding style guides for that language, platform, or API
* Use your best judgment and common sense, always.
* More coming...
