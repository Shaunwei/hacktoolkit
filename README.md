hacktoolkit
===========

Hacktoolkit is the ONE open source project to rule them all (we try to, at least).

The spirit of this project is summarized in this tagline: _**Win hackathons by using bootstrap code to build complete websites and apps in 24 hours.**_

### Goals

* Easy to use; easy onboarding process
* Clean, robust code
* Find the best examples that are already existing (don't reinvent the wheel), and import them as submodules

## This `README`

This `README` is about the hacktoolkit library hosted at: https://github.com/hacktoolkit/hacktoolkit

For information about the project, see the website: http://hacktoolkit.com

* There will only be one repository, ever, for Hacktoolkit.
* The goal is to be one repository that users can clone and immediately start using, not 47 different repositories.
* Code is organized into sub-folders, each with their own READMEs.
* Always read the `README` files in subdirectories before using the code so that your computer or mobile device doesn't blow up.

## Nomenclature

### Hacktoolkit vs hacktoolkit

Use **Hacktoolkit** (capital, proper name, one word, no spaces or hyphens) when referring to the project or code.

Use `hacktoolkit` (all lowercase) only when referring to the code, library, or package name.

### Names in code

* Java or Android package names, for example, should start with `com.hacktoolkit`
* `htk` is the preferred abbreviation
